A parser implementation for the C- programming language using JFlex and CUP..

To build the parser, type "make" in the current directory, which will 
generate an executable program called "Main".

To parse a C- file like "example.cm", type 

    "java -cp /usr/share/java/cup.jar:. Main example.cm [-a] [-s] [-c]" 

The -a command will display the syntax tree
The -s command will display the symbol table
The -c command will compile the code into the Tiny Machine assembly language, provided there are no semantic errors

To rebuild the parser, type "make clean" and type "make" again.

Additionally, the testing folder stores several different files used to test the parser
and how it responds to different errors.
